Changelog:

V3.4:
	- added import/export facilities for settings
	- got rid of all useless transparent pixels to gain some resolution in certain cases
	- refactored the UI a little
	- altered default size and main spacing to improve quality at a distance

V3.3:
	- added whole new section for source editing: cropping, rotation, mirroring, source-width control, splitting image into multiple sections to be processed separately
	- moved most of the info into dedicated overlay
	- added a bit of instructions in the above mentioned overlay
	- moved reset settings button to the left (cause it only applies to the left-hand-side settings, i.e. the generation settings)
	- removed the obnoxious "select all on focus" for regular textboxes, only applies to yellow textareas now

V3.2:
	- free placement of arc signs now gets restored properly across page reloads
	- arc signs get marked in red after the processing only if they actually overflow any limit
	- the image preview in the placement preview area now gets resized in height properly after execution
	- replaced all the images with data URIs to ensure the page looks right even when downloaded and run from a local copy

V3.1.BETA:
	- rebuilt preview placement area completely, allowing for free placement of single arc signs
	- refactored main slicing algorithm to avoid locking the browser and to show a progress of the actual image processing

V3:
	- reorganized interface grouping settings in different modes (basic, medium, advanced, insane)
	- added settings memory (survives page refreshes) and a settings reset button
	- added vertical error correction (to account for slight overlaps from slice to slice)
	- added free-text incipit for each code
	- added <indent> tag
	- added <align> tag
	- added icons to most settings
	- after execution, the height of the image in the placement preview area survives the change of settings to let you tweak the <offset> value
	- removed pattern recipes (creating patterns is still possible just like in previous version, I've only removed the recipes: if you were smart enough to understand them you're smart enough to create them fiddling with the settings on your own, besides no one seems to have used them at all so far)

V2.6:
	- fixed overlapping, duplicated row across slides
	- improved slide placement (they were slightly off even before the duplicated row)
	- fixed line count in each textarea
	- improved preview of sign placement
	- added preview of graphic extension

V2.5:
	- selecting / dragging an image shows its preview immediately
	- added ability to arrange arc signs in different ways
	- added the preview of both the signs arrangement and the graphics placement related to the arc signs (hover it to enlarge it)
	- the graphic now starts exactly at the chosen offset and grows towards the bottom, not somewhat higher than the chosen offset as it happened in previous versions
	- removed the ability to omit offset and zoffset tags by setting them to zero (the offset defaulting to about 0.55 when omitted is misleading in first place, and keeping them always in the code makes it easier to tweak them in the game)
	- added checkered background to the source and result previews to highlight transparent areas
	- the result preview now shows the gamma correction and grayscale effects
	- the textareas get clearly marked in red if any limit gets exceeded
	- added a "Working..." cover to show when the script is running
	- changed the default value of offset from 0 to 2, to make it stand a bit higher than the first arc sign
	- changed the default value of zoffset from 0.51 to 0 to have it stand exactly in the middle of the column
	- refactored the generation algorithm to optimize the slices usage (there won't be any wasted signs using just 2 or 3 K chars, perhaps just the last one depending on the settings); this got also rid of the bug that trimmed some lines at the end of the source image
	- refactored the whole script into separate files to ease the development

V2.4:
	- added slicing feature
	- added grayscale convertion option
	- added offset and zoffset controls
	- added font & character controls
	- added some recipes to create simple patterns
	- major change in spacing tweak: its sign has been reversed and now the <size> value remains untouched, it's the <mspace> and <line-height> values that change depending on the tweak
	- restyled the page a bit and tidied up code a little

V2.3: fixed extremely silly bug in alpha handling

V2.2: added gamma correction, fixed a bug that created artifacts at the border of the image in some cases

V2.1: converted line endings from "\n" to "\r\n"

V2: uses alternate font and periods to draw fully opaque pixels, added options to tweak the tag values, added autosize feature, added short hex values feature

V1: first version using <mark> technique
